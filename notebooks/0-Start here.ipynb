    "Eventually, after a year or two, I'll revisit a subject. I recently noticed that I had not talked about music related things in almost two and a half years, so I did 5 quick Jupyter notebooks and presented that. Interestingly enough, none of these 5 things were covered back then. This repo includes edited versions of the notebooks, based on the interactions at the meeting during my presentation."
