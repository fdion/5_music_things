# 5_music_things
Five music related things in Jupyter Notebook. I like to cover 5 things in 5 minutes for lightning talks. Or one thing. At the local Python user group, sometimes questions or other circumstances turn these 5 in 5 more into a 5 in 10-15...

Eventually, after a year or two, I'll revisit a subject. I recently noticed that I had not talked about music related things in almost two and a half years, so I did 5 quick Jupyter notebooks and presented that. Interestingly enough, none of these 5 things were covered back then. This repo includes edited versions of the notebooks, based on the interactions at the meeting during my presentation.
